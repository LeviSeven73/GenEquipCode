Equipment Code Generator

This is a generator program developed by LeviSeven that simulates all possible property variations of equipment in Minesweeper.Online (WoM), presented in the form of an equipment code. 

To generate all equipment codes with a specific quality, the program will calculate all combination sequences that sum up to the given quality number, then apply permutation models to the sequences and filter duplicates using the TreeSet data type, and eventually write the generation result into the output folder. The compiler may request 15-20 seconds to process the simulation across qualities.

You may download the overall project to monitor the generation process, or you may acquire the result by simply downloading the output/codes.txt document.
